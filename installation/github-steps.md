# How to track your files using Github
Keep your files in a local folder on your computer. Make changes there. Git won't track every change you make unless you commit and push the changes to your repo.

1. make changes to your files
2. git automatically tracks changes those changes (and Github Desktop notes them)
3. commit those changes with a message that describes them
4. push the commit to the remote repo
