When youâ€™re in the command line, you are always in a particular place on your computer, and it usually starts here:
> /Users/_user_
or **~**

pwd: "present working directory" - shows your current path
cd : "change directory" - use this command to change your location
ls : "list files" - will print all the files in your current directory
